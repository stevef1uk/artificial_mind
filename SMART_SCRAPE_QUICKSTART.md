## Integration with Go Scraper Service

The Smart Scrape Studio is connected to the **Go Playwright Scraper** running on port 8087:

- **Endpoint**: `http://localhost:8087/api/scraper/generic`
- **Time**: 8-20 seconds per scrape
- **Accuracy**: 85-99% extraction success
- **Scalability**: 3-5 concurrent pages

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Loading Smart Scrape Studio..." stays visible
- **Issue**: iframe not loading
- **Fix**: Ensure static files exist at `/monitor/static/smart_scrape/`
- **Try**: Hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)

### "Cannot reach scraper service"
- **Issue**: Port 8087 not accessible
- **Fix**: Start scraper: `cd services/playwright_scraper && ./playwright_scraper`

### Extraction results are empty
- **Issue**: Website structure differs from expectations
- **Try**: Use CSS selectors instead of natural language
- **Example**: `.product-title` instead of "product names"
