# FSM Knowledge Base Growth

## Overview

The Artificial Mind FSM actively grows and improves the knowledge base through continuous learning, concept discovery, and gap analysis. This creates a self-improving AI system that becomes more knowledgeable over time.

## Recent Improvements (2025)

### Enhanced Learning Focus and Success

The system now includes eight major improvements to make learning more focused and successful:

1. **Goal Outcome Learning System**: Tracks which goals succeed/fail and learns from outcomes
2. **Enhanced Goal Scoring**: Uses historical success data to prioritize goals
3. **Hypothesis Value Pre-Evaluation**: Filters low-value hypotheses before testing
4. **Focused Learning Strategy**: Focuses on promising areas (70% focused, 30% exploration)
5. **Meta-Learning System**: Learns about its own learning process
6. **Improved Concept Discovery**: Uses LLM-based semantic analysis instead of pattern matching
7. **LLM-Based Novelty Assessment**: Uses LLM to assess if knowledge is novel and worth learning (NEW)
8. **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks if knowledge already exists before storing (NEW)

See `LEARNING_FOCUS_IMPROVEMENTS.md` and `RELEVANCE_FILTERING_IMPROVEMENTS.md` for detailed information about these improvements.

## Knowledge Growth Flow

```
User Input → FSM → learn → discover_concepts → evaluate → grow_knowledge → archive

        Knowledge Base Growth
                ↓
    New Concepts + Relationships + Examples
```

## Key Growth Mechanisms

### 1. **Concept Discovery** (in `learn` state)
- Analyzes episodes for new domain concepts
- Extracts patterns and relationships using LLM-based semantic analysis
- **Assesses novelty and value** using LLM before storing (NEW)
- **Checks if concept already exists** to prevent duplicates (NEW)
- Creates new concepts with confidence scores
- Auto-creates concepts above threshold (only if novel and valuable)

### 2. **Gap Analysis** (in `learn` state)
- Identifies missing relationships
- Finds concepts without constraints
- Discovers concepts lacking examples
- Prioritizes gaps by importance

### 3. **Knowledge Growth** (in `evaluate` state)
- Creates new concepts from discoveries (only if novel and valuable)
- **Filters out obvious/common knowledge** using LLM assessment (NEW)
- **Prevents duplicate knowledge** by checking existing knowledge base (NEW)
- Fills high-priority knowledge gaps
- Updates existing concepts with new information
- Adds relationships and constraints

### 4. **Consistency Validation** (in `evaluate` state)
- Checks for contradictions
- Resolves conflicts
- Validates relationships
- Ensures knowledge integrity

## Example Knowledge Growth Scenario

### Initial State
```
Knowledge Base:
- Matrix (Math domain)
- Prime Number (Math domain)
- Docker Container (Programming domain)
```

### User Input: "Generate code for matrix multiplication with error handling"

### FSM Processing with Knowledge Growth

#### 1. **Perceive & Learn Phase**
```
🔍 Discovering new concepts from episodes
📚 Discovered 3 new concepts:
  - Matrix Multiplication (Math, confidence: 0.85)
  - Error Handling (Programming, confidence: 0.78)
  - Input Validation (Programming, confidence: 0.72)

🔍 Analyzing knowledge gaps
🕳️ Found 4 knowledge gaps:
  - Matrix has no relationships (priority: 6)
  - Matrix Multiplication missing constraints (priority: 5)
  - Error Handling needs examples (priority: 4)
  - Missing relationship: Matrix → Matrix Multiplication (priority: 7)
```

#### 2. **Hypothesize & Plan Phase**
```
Generated hypothesis: "Matrix multiplication requires compatible dimensions"
Plan: Create code with dimension validation and error handling
```

#### 3. **Execute Phase**
```
🔒 MANDATORY PRINCIPLES CHECK - Code generation allowed
🔒 PRE-EXECUTION PRINCIPLES CHECK - Execution safe
✅ Code generated and executed successfully
```

#### 4. **Evaluate & Grow Phase**
```
🌱 Growing knowledge base

✅ Added constraint: A.cols == B.rows
✅ Added example: 2x3 * 3x2 = 2x2
✅ Created new concept: Error Handling
✅ Added relationship: Matrix Multiplication → Error Handling (USES)
✅ Added constraint: Must validate dimensions before multiplication
