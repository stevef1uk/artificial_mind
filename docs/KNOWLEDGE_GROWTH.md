# FSM Knowledge Base Growth

## Overview

The Artificial Mind FSM actively grows and improves the knowledge base through continuous learning, concept discovery, and gap analysis. This creates a self-improving AI system that becomes more knowledgeable over time.

## Knowledge Growth Flow

```
User Input → FSM → learn → discover_concepts → evaluate → grow_knowledge → archive
                ↓
        Knowledge Base Growth
                ↓
    New Concepts + Relationships + Examples
```

## Key Growth Mechanisms

### 1. **Concept Discovery** (in `learn` state)
- Analyzes episodes for new domain concepts
- Extracts patterns and relationships
- Creates new concepts with confidence scores
- Auto-creates concepts above threshold

### 2. **Gap Analysis** (in `learn` state)
- Identifies missing relationships
- Finds concepts without constraints
- Discovers concepts lacking examples
- Prioritizes gaps by importance

### 3. **Knowledge Growth** (in `evaluate` state)
- Creates new concepts from discoveries
- Fills high-priority knowledge gaps
- Updates existing concepts with new information
- Adds relationships and constraints

### 4. **Consistency Validation** (in `evaluate` state)
- Checks for contradictions
- Resolves conflicts
- Validates relationships
- Ensures knowledge integrity

## Example Knowledge Growth Scenario

### Initial State
```
Knowledge Base:
- Matrix (Math domain)
- Prime Number (Math domain)
- Docker Container (Programming domain)
```

### User Input: "Generate code for matrix multiplication with error handling"

### FSM Processing with Knowledge Growth

#### 1. **Perceive & Learn Phase**
```
🔍 Discovering new concepts from episodes
📚 Discovered 3 new concepts:
  - Matrix Multiplication (Math, confidence: 0.85)
  - Error Handling (Programming, confidence: 0.78)
  - Input Validation (Programming, confidence: 0.72)

🔍 Analyzing knowledge gaps
🕳️ Found 4 knowledge gaps:
  - Matrix has no relationships (priority: 6)
  - Matrix Multiplication missing constraints (priority: 5)
  - Error Handling needs examples (priority: 4)
  - Missing relationship: Matrix → Matrix Multiplication (priority: 7)
```

#### 2. **Hypothesize & Plan Phase**
```
Generated hypothesis: "Matrix multiplication requires compatible dimensions"
Plan: Create code with dimension validation and error handling
```

#### 3. **Execute Phase**
```
🔒 MANDATORY PRINCIPLES CHECK - Code generation allowed
🔒 PRE-EXECUTION PRINCIPLES CHECK - Execution safe
✅ Code generated and executed successfully
```

#### 4. **Evaluate & Grow Phase**
```
🌱 Growing knowledge base
✅ Created new concept: Matrix Multiplication
✅ Added relationship: Matrix → Matrix Multiplication (REQUIRES)
✅ Added constraint: A.cols == B.rows
✅ Added example: 2x3 * 3x2 = 2x2
✅ Created new concept: Error Handling
✅ Added relationship: Matrix Multiplication → Error Handling (USES)
✅ Added constraint: Must validate dimensions before multiplication
✅ Added example: Dimension mismatch → throw DimensionError

🔍 Validating knowledge consistency
✅ Knowledge consistency validation completed
```

### Final State

  ├─ Constraints: A.cols == B.rows, Must validate dimensions
  ├─ Examples: 2x3 * 3x2 = 2x2, 3x3 * 3x1 = 3x1
  └─ Properties: Associative, Not commutative

- Error Handling (Programming domain) [NEW]
  ├─ Relationships: Matrix Multiplication → Error Handling (USES)
  ├─ Constraints: Must catch dimension errors
  ├─ Examples: DimensionError, ValueError
  └─ Properties: Defensive programming, User-friendly

## Growth Metrics

The FSM tracks knowledge growth metrics:

```go
type KnowledgeGrowthMetrics struct {
    ConceptsCreated    int     `json:"concepts_created"`
    RelationshipsAdded int     `json:"relationships_added"`
    ConstraintsAdded   int     `json:"constraints_added"`
    ExamplesAdded      int     `json:"examples_added"`
    GapsFilled         int     `json:"gaps_filled"`
    ContradictionsResolved int `json:"contradictions_resolved"`
    GrowthRate         float64 `json:"growth_rate"`
    ConsistencyScore   float64 `json:"consistency_score"`
}
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### **Neo4j Integration**
- New concepts stored as nodes
- Relationships created as edges
- Properties and constraints as node attributes
- Examples stored as separate nodes with relationships
