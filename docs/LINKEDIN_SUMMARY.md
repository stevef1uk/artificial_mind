- **Search and discovery** - Intelligent capability finding
- **Multi-domain isolation** - Specialized capabilities per domain
- **Real-time updates** - Dynamic action loading and execution

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture:

- **Go-based HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planner**
- **Self-aware learning system** - Goal tracking, episode recording, belief updates
- **Docker container execution** - Secure, scalable code execution
- **Multi-language runtime support** - Python, Go, JavaScript, Java, C++, Rust
- **Go module management** - Automatic dependency resolution
- **Redis for persistence and caching** - Including self-model data
- **Ollama LLM integration** for code generation
- **RESTful API** for all operations
- **Production-ready** deployment

## ‚úÖ Proven Use Cases:

1. **Mathematical Computing** - Real prime calculations, Fibonacci sequences, complex algorithms
2. **Code Generation & Execution** - AI generates and runs code in multiple languages
3. **E-commerce Order Processing** - Complete order-to-fulfillment workflows
4. **Content Management** - AI-powered content creation and publishing
5. **Financial Analysis** - Portfolio management and risk assessment
6. **Weather Forecasting** - Data analysis and prediction workflows
7. **Multi-Domain AI Assistant** - Specialized capabilities across different domains

## üéâ What Makes This Special:

- **Real code execution** - Not just planning, but actual code generation and execution
- **Self-aware learning** - System tracks goals, records episodes, and learns from experience
- **Multi-language support** - Python, Go, JavaScript, Java, C++, Rust
- **Docker-based security** - Isolated, secure code execution
- **Go module management** - Automatic dependency resolution
- **Self-managing** - No manual configuration required
- **Domain-agnostic** - Works for any business use case
- **AI-powered** - Learns new capabilities automatically
- **Production-ready** - Enterprise-grade persistence and scalability
- **Zero downtime** - Add capabilities without system restart
